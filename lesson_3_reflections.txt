When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I need to collaborate with other people on one project.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because it gives me the possiblity to decide whether and which part I want to syn from Gibhub to local.
    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

forks: copy from GitHub repo to GitHub repo
clones: copy from GitHub to local or from local to local
branch: only happlen within one repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
